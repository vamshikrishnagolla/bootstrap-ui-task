## Objective
The objective of this project was to explore Bootstrap 5 documentation and examples,
understand how different UI components work, and build clean, modern, and responsive
web pages by remixing Bootstrap components.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)


1. I started by exploring the official Bootstrap 5 documentation and example pages.
2. I identified reusable UI components such as navbar, cards, hero section, and forms.
3. I created three separate pages: Home, About, and Contact.
4. I reused the same navbar and footer across all pages to maintain consistency.
5. I used Bootstrap’s grid system and utility classes for spacing and responsiveness.
6. I tested the UI on different screen sizes using browser developer tools.
7. Finally, I pushed the code to GitHub and deployed it using GitHub Pages.

## Challenges Faced
Initially, understanding how to combine multiple Bootstrap components into a single
layout was challenging. I solved this by breaking the UI into sections and using
Bootstrap’s grid and spacing utilities.
